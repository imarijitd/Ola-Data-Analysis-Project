# Ola-Data-Analysis-Project

In this end-to-end project, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of Ola ride data to extract and manipulate datasets, identifying key trends in customer service improvement, customer retention,  popular vehicle type segregation, along with drawing other useful insights.

All the important files containing SQL queries, excel data and Power BI dashboard relating to the project are attached herewith for reference.

A project overview file is also attached which describes the process about how the project was started from scratch and what steps were taken to complete it.
